# HighestPalindromeExercise

Hi! Please read all this file first

The first thing is to configure your environment you need to follow the next steps:

-1 Go to https://nodejs.org/es/ and download and install Node JS for your SO
* To check if node was installed correctly run "node -v" on your terminal to check your Node JS version

-2 Install the dependencies with "yarn install"

For the real-time exercise you need to complete the function "highestValuePalindrome" inside the file "highestValuePalindrome.ts"

Also in that file you will find all the explanation needed for the exercise.

**You can "not look" at the file "highestValuePalindrome.test.ts" in the entire interview time.

When you are done with the function you must run "yarn test" and verify that all test are OK
