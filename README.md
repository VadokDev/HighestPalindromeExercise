# HighestPalindromeExercise

Hi! Welcome to the real-time exercise of Neat's interview. 

**Please read all this file first**

## Configuration

The first thing is to configure your environment you need to follow the next steps:

1. Go to [Node JS page](https://nodejs.org/es/), download and install Node JS for your SO
    - To check if node was installed correctly run `node -v` on your terminal to check your Node JS version

2. Install the dependencies with "yarn install"

## Exercise

For the real-time exercise you need to complete the function **highestValuePalindrome** inside the file **highestValuePalindrome.ts**

Also in that file you will find all the explanation needed for the exercise.

**You can NOT look at the file "highestValuePalindrome.test.ts" in the entire interview time**

When you are done with the function you must run `yarn test` and verify that all test are OK.
